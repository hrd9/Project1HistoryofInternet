    When the dot-com bubble burst in 1998, entrepreneurs around the world ran to their nearest venture capitalists for new ideas and capital. Many did not manage the influx of capital prudently, and overspent on ideas rather than managing them prudently. Newcom business plans were predicated on the assumption that by using the Internet, they would bypass the distribution channels of existing businesses and therefore not have to compete with them.
    Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%. In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619%, 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000% in value. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics. An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to trade on the financial market were common. The news media took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market. Sir John Templeton successfully shorted stocks at the peak of the bubble, shorting stocks just before the expiration of lockup periods.
    Telecommunications equipment companies invested more than $500 billion, mostly financed with debt, into laying fiber optic cable and adding switches, and building wireless networks. Spectrum auctions for 3G in the United Kingdom and Germany raised £22.5 billion and £30 billion respectively. When financing became hard to find as the bubble burst, the high debt ratios of these companies led to bankruptcy. Several telecom executives sold stock before the crash including Philip Anschutz, who reaped $1.9 billion, Joseph Nacchio, and Gary Winnick, who sold $748 million worth of shares.

    Ultimately, as we discussed about the inflating balloon, the prices rose approximately around five times. Then, the slow deflating balloon came between 2000 to 2002. And finally had to burst out in 2002. Well, one of the reasons the bubble burst is the 9/11 Attack, which was a news and is still considered a turning point.
    As we closely see, we can understand that, many companies died. Investors were facing a huge loss, like literally a huge loss. Where we can see the bad side of this happening, there was a good side, for some. Amazon's Company loss was present, but gradually, the revenue of this enormous company increased exponentially. To elaborate, the stock price of Amazon after this period dropped drastically. But later on, the same stock price increased approximately 100 times. Thus, in the end, we can that, this example of bubble burst proved to be a huge lesson of human nature for every person who has faced it.
    There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000, but there was virtually no impact or disruption due to adequate preparation. Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the Year 2000 problem. Two dot-com companies purchased ad spots for Super Bowl XXXIII, and 17 dot-Com companies bought ad spots the following year for Superbowl XXXIV. On January 10, 2000, America Online announced a merger with Time Warner, the largest to date. 12 ads of the 61 ads for Super Bowl XXXIV were purchased by dot-coms (sources state ranges from 12 up to 19 companies). At that time, the cost for a 30-second commercial cost between $1.9 million and $2.2 million. Alan Greenspan, then Chair of the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many to have caused the bursting of the internet bubble. On March 13, 2000, news that Japan had entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks. The Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&P 500 rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks. That same day, MicroStrategy announced a revenue restatement due to aggressive accounting practices and its stock price fell 62% in a day. On November 9, 2000, Pets.com went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO. By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs. In January 2001, just three dot-com companies bought advertising spots during Super Bowl XXXV. By the end of the stock market downturn of 2002, stocks had lost $5 trillion in market capitalization.

    Amazon and eBay were considered lightning, sparkling and shining bursts around the year 1990. As any other famous company, idea of an online bookstore under the name "Amazon" started in a garage in Seattle. It was none other than Jeff Bezos, a guy from the Wall Street, a highly organized and inquisitive being and a spreadsheet enthusiast, who was doing the task. With the popularity of internet and millions of users using it in every possible part of the planet, this was an idea which cannot go down or flop.
    The idea of bookstore was simple. His views and key points summarized to a point that no library or bookstore can store every book present in this planet. Approximately, during the same timeline, Pierre Omidyar, just like any other coder, had a creative mind. He had an idea of building a site, where people can auction goods. Post Labour Day, later in around 1995, he started creating just a simple code in which we can create an advertisement, list up all the similar ones and bid in similar items of others like actual usual auctions happen, but in a virtual manner. At the time of their initiation of start-ups, we can observe that, Bezos had a very commercial mind and Omidyar, well, he was, earlier said, just a humble coder.
    With Internet spreading like wild fire, Bezos and Omidyar started to create new models of commerce, or we can say E-Commerce. With the integration of Internet and emerging popularity of nimble, affordable and robust personal computers, they commercialized their initial idea and took a step forward, which proved to be a golden one for them.
